# Financial Analysis with Python

This project is a Python script for analyzing financial records. The provided financial dataset is in the budget_data.csv file. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### What this script does

The Python script is built to analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The resulting analysis looks like the following:

  ```text
